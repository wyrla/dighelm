Small util that allows creating ObinsKit key macros in your computer from a file containing a list of strings.

### Installation/Running

Clone the repo and run `npm i`.

Create a file that contains a list of newline separated strings for which you want to create macros for. For instance:

```
ha
haha
i
amalist
```

For now, only fully lowercase strings without spaces are supported (symbols may or may not be supported, try it).

Locate the path of your users' ObinsKit sqlite database. In Arch Linux it is `$HOME/.config/ObinsKit/Run.core`.
In other platforms the file name will be the same but the location will be different.

Cd into the repo dir and run `node index.js <dbPath> <stringsPath>` or `node index.js <dbPath> "string to macro"`. 

Each string will generate a macro, which you will then be able to see in the app itself.

Subsequent executions will not override existing macros or other macros that already existed.

If you'd like to generate macros for a new list of strings, you'll have to manually delete them in the app, or use a sqlite db brower to do so directly in the db.

(Hint: the macros generated by digHelm start at id 69 and go up from that).

### Roadmap 
  * Properly support spaces
  * Properly support uppercase
  * Properly support symbols
  * Options to control macro overwrite 
  * Control iteration start id
  * ????
  * Profit

### Compatible/Tested ObinsKit versions
  * 1.1.4

### DISCLAIMER
 
digHelm may, and very probably will, break or stop working altogether in the future, since it relies on generating a 
binary macro format that is then directly written to the keyboard by the app when you assign it to a key and download it.
Which means that unpredictable stuff may happen.

As such, I feel that I must include the following disclaimer:

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE AUTHOR ``AS IS'' AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

TLDR: I will not be held responsible if your keyboard goes up in flames because of digHelm.
